## Introduction: What is an in-process background queue? Why would you use one?
An in-process background queue is a way to defer work to be done later, without blocking the current thread. This can be useful for tasks that take a long time to complete, or for tasks that you don't want to block the UI thread for

## Infrastructure Options
- [Azure Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/service-bus/)
- [Azure Storage Queues](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/queues/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)

There are pros and cosn to all of these services. Based which cloud, throughput, features (FIFO, guaranteed delivery), on prem, etc. One common problem they solve is message durability.

What if you're not willing to take on that additional infrastructure for reasons (security, available skillset, IT Ops, etc.)

## Background queue implementation

To implement an in-process background  queue, you will need to use the Channels library. Channels provides a  way to create and manage queues of messages. You can then use the  MediatR library to send messages to the queue. MediatR is a dependency  injection framework for .NET that provides a way to decouple your code  into separate concerns.



## Conclusion

- Conclusion: Using an in-process background queue can provide a number of benefits, including:
    - Increased performance: By deferring work to be done later, you can  free up the current thread to do other things. This can improve the  performance of your application.
    - Improved scalability: By using a background queue, you can scale  your application more easily. You can add more workers to the queue to  handle more work.
    - Improved reliability: By decoupling your code, you can make your  application more reliable. If one part of your application fails, the  other parts of your application can continue to run.







III. MediatR for Message Processing

GPT intro

In modern applications, it's increasingly common to perform time-consuming or resource-intensive tasks in the background, without blocking the main thread or user interface. One popular approach to background processing is the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern, which allows an application to send a request to a background process, receive a response, and continue executing other tasks in the meantime.

In this blog post, we'll demonstrate how to build an in-process background queue using Channels and MediatR in C#, specifically to solve the problem of implementing the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern. We'll walk you through the process of creating a channel for background processing, using MediatR to handle messages, and ultimately building a robust background queue that can handle multiple requests and responses simultaneously. Whether you're working on a web application, desktop application, or other type of software, mastering the art of background processing is an essential skill for any developer. So, let's dive in!
